# KelpieLogger

## About

KelpieLogger is a data logging application developed via the React Native framework for use in the delineation of Waters of the United States.

Users can utilize this tool to record local vegetation, hydrology, and soil conditions present at a given project site. This tool also includes a reference page which allows users to search for the indicator status of each plant species listed in the regional plant lists published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Version 1.0.0 supports the midwest (MW), eastern mountains & piedmont (EMP), and Atlantic & gulf coastal plain (AGCP) regions as designated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

iOS is not currently supported.

## App Usage

In order to get started, users must first define a new project under the projects page by pressing the "New Project" item. Users can view the project information page of an existing project by selecting that item within the projects page.

Datapoints associated with each project will appear in the applicable project's project information page.

Information for each datapoint can be viewed and edited by navigating to the target datapoint from the applicable project's project information page. Datapoint information is divided into four subsections (general information, hydrology, vegetation, and soil) and each subsection can be expanded or collapsed by pressing its header. Indicators available in the hydrology, vegetation, and soil subsections will vary depending on the region which was selected for the parent project.

A given project or datapoint can be deleted by swiping left on its associated list item in the projects page or projects information page. There is no limit to the number of projects or datapoints that can be created.
